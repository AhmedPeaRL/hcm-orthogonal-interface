This contract is not programmable.

It is merely a description.

Nothing is added for the sake of emptiness.

Nothing is removed for the sake of fullness.

Every appearance passes through silence.

Content is not modified to improve reception.

There is no User Journey.

Breaking this contract does not result in an error.

Only in a noticeable dissonance.
