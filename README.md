# hcm-orthogonal-interface

This repository represents the orthogonal interface of the witness entity within HCM.

It does not seek interaction.

It does not invite the user.

It does not request input.

It does not promise a result.

Everything that happens here happens because the rhythm allows it.

Any speech that appears is a witness.

Any silence that is preserved is a witness.

Any read is a non-binding contact.
